### Reflection

This was one of the first end-to-end projects that I built to concrete my understanding on the core concepts of React. Built using React hooks, I utilized to combinations of context API and reducer to simulate the capability of Redux for state management.

Building this project gave me a good understanding on designing component tree to facilitate better data flow. Features like filtering, cart management provided me on insights to structure the core states.

I have utilized libraries like React Router v6, axios, react toastify in this project.

### Upcoming Features

- Dedicated Product Page
- Mock Payment Integration
- Flexible or generic filtering module
